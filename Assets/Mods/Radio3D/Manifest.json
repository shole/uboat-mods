  "description": "This mod allows radio music to play in 3D views.\nLoudspeaker minimum distance is also adjusted slightly so the spatialization is not so sharp and more evenly heard through the sub interior.\nOn map loudspeaker audio mixer was switched to interior mixer for more consistent audio fidelity and volume vs. interior. It is also no longer impacted by the \"music volume\" slider.\n\nThis mod has been tested with 2025.1.1.\nThis mod works with existing savegames and does not alter game state.\n\nSource for this mod is available here.\nhttps://github.com/shole/uboat-mods",
