{"name":"Decimal Distances (global)","version":"1.0","description":"Replace distance formatting to show decimals for ranges <5km or <3nmi.

By default the game displays all ranges above 1km or 1nmi as integers, which is really inaccurate for such a close distance.
This mod will show distance decimals to 0.1 precision on map for ranges below 5km or 3nmi.
I thought of making it full meter value, but maybe that would be unnecessarily accurate and verbose.

This mod changes formatting GLOBALLY, and it is possible this may cause problems somewhere.
Therefore I recommend you use the map line-only version instead;
