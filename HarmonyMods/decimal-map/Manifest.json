{"name":"Show Decimal Distances on Map","version":"1.0","description":"Show decimals on map for ranges <5km or <3nmi 

By default the game displays all ranges above 1km or 1nmi as integers, which is really inaccurate for such a close distance.
This mod will show distance decimals to 0.1 precision on map for ranges below 5km or 3nmi.
I thought of making it full meter value, but maybe that would be unnecessarily accurate and verbose.

This mod has been tested with B129.
This mod works with existing savegames and does not alter game state.
