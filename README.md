# shole's uboat mods
This is the source repository for my mods for the game UBOAT.<br/>
https://store.steampowered.com/app/494840/UBOAT/<br/>
The mods are available on steam workshop.<br/>
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991780592/myworkshopfiles/?appid=494840<br/>

This repository contains the following mods:
* No Discipline - disables the discipline feature from the game
* No Discipline (Task Version) - same as above, implemented as a background task, for redundancy in case other fails
* Show Decimal Distances on Map - show decimals on map for <5km or <3nmi ranges
* Decimal Distances (global) - same as above, but global. may cause issues somewhere(?) so not recommended
# usage
1. using unity 2019.4.15f1
2. create new unity mod from uboat launcher
3. open it and hit "tools/update game assemblies"
4. git clone this repo (or download zip)
5. drop into the unity mod folder, overwriting things (i have deleted the packages/uboat/shaders folder)
