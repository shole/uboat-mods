# shole's uboat mods
This is the source repository for my mods for the game UBOAT.<br/>
https://store.steampowered.com/app/494840/UBOAT/<br/>
The mods are available on steam workshop.<br/>
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991780592/myworkshopfiles/?appid=494840<br/>

This repository contains the following mods:
* No Fatigue - disables the fatigue feature from the game
* No Discipline - disables the discipline feature from the game
* No Discipline (Task Version) - same as above, implemented as a background task, for redundancy in case other fails
* Change Campaign Settings - allows changing gameplay settings in a campaign savegame already in progress
